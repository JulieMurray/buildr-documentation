The docs in this section are designed to be used for completely fresh installations of Joomla. 

## Before you start

The guide assumes that you have:

- Installed Joomla 3+
- You have used the default English sample data
- You have installed all of the items outlines in the <a href="starting-from-scratch">Starting with a fresh version of Joomla</a> section.
- Set up all of the required modules as outlined in the <a href="starting-from-scratch/items-to-create">items to create</a> section.


## Loading the configuration for the theme you want to replicate

Once you have followed the items above you will need to apply the saved settings for the template you wish to replicate.

As an example if you are using the revision theme you would:

- Navigate to the Buildr template settings in the template manager
- Click the select box next to the load saved settings button
- Select the revision template option
- Click load saved settings
- Save the template using the save button in the top left corner.
