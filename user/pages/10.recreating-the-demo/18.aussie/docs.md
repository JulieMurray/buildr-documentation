Aussie is a child theme of the Buildr template. This means it uses the Build.r template and applies Aussie specific style via Buildr's built in child theme functionality.

## A note about child themes
The files for child themes are located in the templates/buildr/child folder and are selected in the template admin design side panel.  You can read a full explanation of child theming in Build.r <a href="../style/using-child-themes">here</a>.


## Installing Aussie

The following applies to situations where you have already installed the Buildr template on your site or are installing buildr for the first time.

**Step 1** - Download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.joomlabamboo.com/downloads/template-downloads?param=buildr">Buildr template</a>.

**Step 2** - Once installed navigate to the template manager and edit the Buildr template.

**Step 3** - Select the Aussie example configuration from the load saved settings dropdown.

After doing this the Aussie child theme will be selected and the Aussie preset will be set in the preset dropdown list.

Applying the Aussie example configuration sets the required theme panel options including the layout blocks used on the demo site in the layout tool.

**Step 4** - Click Save. After clicking save the required assets for the Aussie theme will be generated (theme files, css files etc) and will now be available for use on your website.


You can customize the template through the theme control panel, according to the image:
