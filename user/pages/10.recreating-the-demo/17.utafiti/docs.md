![Utafiti](theme_devices.jpg)

Utafiti is a child theme of the Buildr template. This means it uses the Build.r template and applies Utafiti specific style via Buildr's built in child theme functionality.

## A note about child themes
The files for child themes are located in the templates/buildr/child folder and are selected in the template admin design side panel.  You can read a full explanation of child theming in Build.r <a href="../style/using-child-themes">here</a>.


## Installing Utafiti

The following applies to situations where you have already installed the Buildr template on your site or are installing buildr for the first time.

**Step 1** - Download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.joomlabamboo.com/downloads/template-downloads?param=buildr">Buildr template</a>.

**Step 2** - Once installed navigate to the template manager and edit the Buildr template.

**Step 3** - Select the Utafiti example configuration from the load saved settings dropdown.

![Apply Utafiti](gif_select_theme.gif)

After doing this the Utafiti child theme will be selected and the Utafiti preset will be set in the preset dropdown list.

Applying the Utafiti example configuration sets the required theme panel options including the layout blocks used on the demo site in the layout tool.

**Step 4** - Click Save. After clicking save the required assets for the Utafiti theme will be generated (theme files, css files etc) and will now be available for use on your website.


You can customize the template through the theme control panel, according to the image:

## Install the Utafiti quickstart package

If you are starting a new website from scratch we highly recommend installing the Utafiti quickstart package. This is by far the simplest way to recreate the demo site on your server.

The logo in the Utafiti template uses a custom html module published to the logo position.

The markup used in this position is:

	<h1><a href="index.php">{zen-heart}{/zen-heart}Â UTAFITI</a></h1>

The logo consists of an icon and text. The icon is displayed using syntax from the zen shortcodes plugin. As per the following image:

## Module Banner Slideshow

![slideshow](screen_banner.png)

The slideshow used on the Utafiti demo features a new type of slideshow that was added to Zentools2 in v2.2.6.

The slideshow is called Slideshow Hero and uses some nifty sliding effects when each slide is moved onto the screen. 

The slideshow features a number of options, as per the screenshot below, including:

- Slideshow height
- The content position
- The ability to disable the background image for a slide based on the number in which it appears in the slideshow.
- The ability to add an overlay. The overlay color and opacity is defined in the Zentools2 theme panel.

See the settings screens:

![slideshow](screen_module_banner_config.png) 


See the other settings:

![slideshow](gif_banner_admin_edit.gif)

The demo for Utafiti uses the title, introtext and readmore elements in the main content area and uses Joomla as the content source.

![slideshow](screen_content_banner.png)

![slideshow](screen_img_slide.png)

The content selection is made according to the image:

![slideshow](content_banner.gif)


The image is automatically retrieved from the item currently set to display however if the image doesn't exist then the slideshow will display a blank tile which uses the primary color set in the Zentools2 theme panel.

![slideshow Setup](screen_content_banner1.png)

To use the Utafiti slideshow style, you need to add a class suffix in the modules advanced settings tab equal to the following (the text must be preceded with a space):
