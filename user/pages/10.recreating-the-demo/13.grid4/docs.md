The Grid4 design is a child theme of the Build.r template. This means it uses the Build.r template and applies Grid4 specific style via Build.r's builtin child theme functionality.

## A note about child themes
Child themes are an additional less file and optional javascript file that are included in the main theme css and javascript, when selected in the template settings. You can read a full explanation of child theming in Build.r <a href="../style/using-child-themes">here</a>.


## Installing Grid4

The following applies to situations where you have already installed the Buildr template on your site or are installing buildr for the first time.

**Step 1** - Download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.joomlabamboo.com/downloads/template-downloads?param=buildr">Buildr template</a>.

**Step 2** - Once installed navigate to the template manager and edit the Buildr template.

**Step 3** - Select the Grid4 example configuration from the load saved settings dropdown.

After doing this the Grid4 child theme will be selected and the Grid4 preset will be set in the preset dropdown list.

Applying the Grid 4 example configuration sets the required theme panel options including the layout blocks used on the demo site in the layout tool.

**Step 4** - Click Save. After clicking save the required assets for the Grid4 theme will be generated (theme files, css files etc) and will now be available for use on your website.


## Install the Grid4 quickstart package

If you are starting a new website from scratch we highly recommend installing the Grid4 quickstart package. This is by far the simplest way to recreate the demo site on your server.

In particular please note that the demo uses the Empty btn button style and the text for the offcanvas uses syntax from the Zen Shortcode plugin to render the menu bar.

**Offcanvas content**

The Offcanvas menu has a login module published to it and can be seen in the offcanvas across all screensizes.

![Offcanvas menu](offcanvas-desktop.jpg)


On screensizes small than the navcollapse breakpoint a menu is dynamically added to the offcanvas. 
offcanvas-smallscreens.

![Offcanvas menu](offcanvas-smallscreens.jpg)

This menu is added to the offcanvas panel because offcanvas is selected as the mobile menu option.

It's a custom html module published to the grid4 position on the front page and sidebar-2 on the sub pages.

**Markup used**

	<div>Â </div>
	<p style="text-align: center;">I am an artist.<br />A lover of good coffee and ...<br />A dreamer of dreams.<br /><br /></p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn-empty" href="index.php/contact">Get in Touch</a></p>

There are two instances of this module published so as to make the module available on the front page  (grid4) next to the frontpage grid and on the sub pages next to the main content (sidebar-2).
