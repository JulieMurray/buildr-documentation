## The Design Panel

The design panel holds 99% of all layout and display related settings. There are a number of settings that have been logically grouped outside of this panel e.g. the dropdown menu widths, however the vast majority of control of the layout and display of the template can be found in the design panel.

## The Layout area

All aspects of the layout are controlled in the layout area. This includes the positioning of specific modules in the layout as well as the widths applied to each module.
