s:441:"<h2>The Design Panel</h2>
<p>The design panel holds 99% of all layout and deisplay related settings. There are a number of settings that have been logically grouped outside of this panel eg the dropdown menu widths, however the vast majority of control of the layout and display of the template can be found in the design panel.</p>
