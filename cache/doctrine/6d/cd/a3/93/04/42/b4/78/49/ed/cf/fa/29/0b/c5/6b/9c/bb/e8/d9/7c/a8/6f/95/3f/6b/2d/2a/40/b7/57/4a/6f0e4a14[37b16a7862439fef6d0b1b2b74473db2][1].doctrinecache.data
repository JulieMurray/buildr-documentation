<h2>Hide the main content button</h2>
<p>When this option is enabled the main content area block will not display on the front page of your site. </p>
<p>This includes pages that do not have a menu item that points to it's specific category. When Joomla can not find a menu item that points to the category of the content you are trying to display it will display the module configuration for the front page.
