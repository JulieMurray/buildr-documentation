s:2514:"<p>An important part of responsive design is being able to hide, show or otherwise control the appearance of elements at various screensizes. </p>
<p>Zen Grid Framework 5 themes have the capacity to hide entire rows at various screen sizes from within the template settings. Specific modules can be hidden at various screensizes by applying a module class to the instance of the module you would like to hide.</p>
<h2>Hiding rows of modules</h2>
<p>The easiest way to hide an entire module row at a given screensize is to use the responsive control blocks in the row settings for your selected row.</p>
<h2>Hiding the banner row</h2>
<p>In the example below we are going to hide the banner module (slideshow) in the Backgrounder theme.</p>
<p>By default the Backgrounder theme in the demo looks like the screenshot below.</p>
<p>As you can see the banner is clearly visible.</p>
<p><img style="" alt="Backgrounder desktop" src="/docs/buildr-documentation/user/pages/02.design/01.layout/08.hiding-rows-at-different-screensizes/backgrounder.jpg" /></p>
<h2>To hide the banner row for a specific screensize</h2>
<p>To hide the banner row for tablet and phone sizes we need to edit the banner row settings by clicking on the pencil on the banner row in the template admin.
<img style="" alt="Backgrounder banner settings" src="/docs/buildr-documentation/user/pages/02.design/01.layout/08.hiding-rows-at-different-screensizes/banner-settings.png" /></p>
<h2>Check the hide button for phone and tablet</h2>
<p>The next step is to click the hide button for both phone and tablet sizes. (The actual screenwidth that these screens sizes relate to is set in the layout &gt; breakpoints tab in the general setting sidebar.).</p>
<p><img style="" alt="Hide Banner" src="/docs/buildr-documentation/user/pages/02.design/01.layout/08.hiding-rows-at-different-screensizes/hide-banner.png" /></p>
<h2>Save your changes</h2>
<p>Once you have done this save your changes by clickin on the save button on the top left of the screen.</p>
<p><img style="" alt="Save" src="/docs/buildr-documentation/user/pages/02.design/01.layout/08.hiding-rows-at-different-screensizes/save.png" /></p>
<h2>The result</h2>
<p>Now on the fronpage of your site you should clearly see the banner row on screensizes at desktop or bigger, while anything smaller than Tablet will be hidden.</p>
