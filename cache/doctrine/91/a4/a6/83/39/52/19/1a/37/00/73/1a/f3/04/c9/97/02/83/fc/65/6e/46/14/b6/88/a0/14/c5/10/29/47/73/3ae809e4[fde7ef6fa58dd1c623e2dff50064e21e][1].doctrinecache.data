s:1398:"<p>This template comes with support for the Bootstrap2 and Bootstrap3 frameworks. </p>
<h2>Do you need to include bootstrap?</h2>
<p>The template does not require Bootstrap in order to render it's various elements. However if you are using a 3rd party component or module that requires the Bootstrap library then you will need to enable this option for your template.</p>
<h2>How to enable the Bootstrap library</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the general settings side panel navigate to the assets panel.</li>
<li>Enable the css framework toggle as per the screenshot below</li>
<li>Select the version of bootstrap that you wish to add support for</li>
<li>Select the items that you wish to load into the template. It's important to note here that if you only need a small portion of the bootstrap framework in your theme then you benefit from a smaller css file if you only select the items required by your component or module.</li>
</ol>
