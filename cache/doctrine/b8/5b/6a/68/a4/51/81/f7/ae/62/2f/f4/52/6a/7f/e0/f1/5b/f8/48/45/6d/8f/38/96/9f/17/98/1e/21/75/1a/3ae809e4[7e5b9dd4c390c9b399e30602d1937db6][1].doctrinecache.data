<h3>Using gzip option on local hosts</h3>
<p>It seems that there is a bug in localhost servers (MAMP and XAMP) that leads to an error when using the gzip function for javascript files. </p>
<p>This error manifests as an unexpected token error in the browser console. There are also cascading errors as a result of this that relate to some of the scripts used by the template.</p>
<p>It is recommended to disable this function when developing a site locally to avoid the issue.</p>";
