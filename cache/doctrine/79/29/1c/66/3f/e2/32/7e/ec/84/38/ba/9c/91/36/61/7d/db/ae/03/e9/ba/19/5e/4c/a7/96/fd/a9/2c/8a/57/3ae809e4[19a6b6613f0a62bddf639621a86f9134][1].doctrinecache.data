<h2>Hide the main content button</h2>
<p>When this option is enabled the main content area block will not display on the front page of your site. </p>
<p>This includes pages that do not have a menu item that points to it's specific category.

This is commonly known as a the Joomla menu item id issue.</p>
<p><strong>If you are having trouble with the template not showing your content an easy step to test this is to disable this option and see if the content is shown.</strong></p>
