<p><img style="" alt="Font Loader" src="/docs/buildr-documentation/user/pages/04.fonts/02.font-loader/fontloader.png" /></p>
<p>When enabled the javascript font loader is used to load fonts. If you are loading a single google font it's likely that having this option disabled will yield a better page load speed. </p>
<p>However if you load more than one font the font loader allows the the page to load before the resources are loaded. This can lead to a FOUT - flash of unstyled content, but it may mean that the page loads faster.</p>
<p>When the setting is disabled the template will load your fonts via the standard css link in the head of the template. </p>
<h2>Which setting should you use?</h2>
<p>In most cases users should have this option disabled. </p>";
